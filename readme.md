## Fingers (or Chopsticks)

##Overview:

This is a game played by two people, in which the object is to eliminate the opposing players hands. Each player starts with one finger on each hand. Player One would then use their left hand to tap Player Twos left hand, increasing Player Two's fingers to 2. Player Two could then use their left hand to tap Player One's left hand giving Player One 3 fingers on their left hand, and so on until one player has 5 fingers on a hand and is then eliminated.
